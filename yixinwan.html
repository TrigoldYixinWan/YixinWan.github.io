## Project Experiences

### Research project:  Hyperparameter Tuning of Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithms**


- Studied the workings of several classic heuristic algorithms, including swarm intelligence, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms.
- Learned how to construct neural networks to solve corresponding problems.

- Utilized genetic algorithms to select the number of neuron layers and the number of neurons in each layer for backpropagation neural networks. The fitness function was set as 1 minus the test error rate of the neural network.

### Research Project:  Price Change Effects on Implied Volatility Across Markets and Assets**


- Analyzed how price changes influence implied volatility using the GARCH model, based on data collected from various geographical markets and asset classes.

- Researched worldwide financial markets, pricing strategies, and business conditions, and effectively applied R programming language in subsequent analyses.

- Presented the relationship between price changes and implied volatility by elucidating the influencing factors, locations, and sizes that form this interconnected dynamic.
### Contest: Evaluation system for poverty alleviation work performance (1st Prize in Huashu cup)
- Responsible for interpreting mathematical models and visualizing results.

- Used Pearson correlation coefficient and decision tree models to identify the most significant factors affecting the total performance score of impoverished villages.

- Employed the entropy weight method to create a comprehensive evaluation model based on rank sum ratio; discovered that Type 3 units performed exceptionally well in poverty alleviation.
